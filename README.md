# Belly_Button_Plotly

## Purpose

Roza is a biological researcher in a prominent micro-biology laboratory. She has the key role of documenting bacterial species that have the ability to synthesize protein that tastes like beef. She believe that this bacterial species resides in the human belly button. To test this hypothesis, Roza has sampled navals of people across the country and these participants have been assigned ID numbers. She has a completed panel for demographic information and we can now visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer. Specifically, we are identifying the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, Roza's volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.

To visualize this information we created an interactive dashboard that contains a horizontal bar chart, bubble chart, and gauge chart which we can switch between participants through a drop down button.

## Charts

#### Horizontal Bar Chart
This chart shows the top ten bacteria that exist in the participants belly button.

#### Bubble Chart
This chart shows how much of each bacteria exists in a sample.

#### Gauge Chart
This chart shows how often the participant washes their belly button.

## Results

Webpage can be accessed here: https://joon-su-choi.github.io/Belly_Button_Plotly/

The following webpage we changed the background of the title and the overall background of the webpage. We have also add a statement for the project overview to give a clear understanding of the webpage.
